# Week 1 â€” App Containerization
## Containerized cruddur app
# Required
To Containerize crudder app. Crudder app was wriiten in react js for frontend and python for backend. I followed the instructions in the videos and then did the home work challenges and merged the two branches together. I also pushed my image to docker hub. 
Here's how I containerized the app using best practice, multi build and also used dockerfile CMD as an external script, configured database, commit and pushed to github, then to dockerhub.

STEP 1:
I cloned the app repository for cruddur and opened it on gitpod workspace.
I reviewed the frontend and backend code then set to write a dockerfile

STEP 2:
After watching the live video on writing a dockerfile, I wrote one and built the image. I decided to add the homework challange by writing the dockerfile in a multi-build format to write the dockerfile, see code below
